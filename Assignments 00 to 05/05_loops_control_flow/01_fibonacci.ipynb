The first two terms in this sequence, Fib(0) and Fib(1), are 0 and 1, and every subsequent term is the sum of the preceding two. Thus, the first several terms in the Fibonacci sequence look like this:\n","\n","### Fib(0) = 0 Fib(1) = 1 Fib(2) = 1 = 0 + 1 Fib(3) = 2 = 1 + 1 Fib(4) = 3 = 1 + 2 Fib(5) = 5 = 2 + 3\n","\n","### Write a program that displays the terms in the Fibonacci sequence, starting with Fib(0) and continuing as long as the terms are less than 10,000 (you should store this value as a constant!).
