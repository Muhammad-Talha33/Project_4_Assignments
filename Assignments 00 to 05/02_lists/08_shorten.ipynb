If lst is already shorter than MAX_LENGTH you should leave it unchanged. We've written a main() function for you which gets a list and passes it into your function once you run the program. For the autograder to pass you will need MAX_LENGTH to be 3, but feel free to change it around to test your program.**"],"metadata":{"id":"qXn2T_LX5WV3"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"UE0EaOpu5Vwm","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1745264982119,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":7251,"user":{"displayName":"My Computer","userId":"03350680548912156739"}},"outputId":"f4647bdb-5dec-4417-e8ce-4e535b4357a4"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop. 1\n","Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop. 2\n","Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop. 3\n","Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop. 4\n","Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop. \n","4\n","['1', '2', '3']\n"]}],"source":["# ðŸ‘‡ this is the part I had to fill out\n","MAX_LENGTH = 3\n","def shorten(lst):\n","  while len(lst) > MAX_LENGTH:\n","    remove_ele = lst.pop()\n","    print(remove_ele)\n","\n","# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #\n","def get_lst():\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Prompts the user to enter one element of the list at a time and returns the resulting list.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    lst = []\n","    elem = input(\"Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop. \")\n","    while elem != \"\":\n","        lst.append(elem)\n","        elem = input(\"Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop. \")\n","    return lst\n","\n","def main():\n","    lst = get_lst()\n","    shorten(lst)\n","    print(lst)\n","\n","\n","if __name__ == '__main__':\n","    main()"]}]}
